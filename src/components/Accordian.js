//Web page  = UI layer + Data layer

//Very Important
//When parent component handles the states of children
//thats is called controlled layer but when parents component
//dont do this its called uncontrolled component

//Parent component is taking care of state of showlist
//so this is called lifting state up
// ðŸ”· What is Lifting State Up?
// Lifting State Up means moving shared state from child components to their closest common parent so that the parent can control and coordinate them.

// âœ… Why?
// When multiple components need to share or sync state, the best practice is to lift the state to a common ancestor and pass it down via props.
